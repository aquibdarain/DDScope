            <p>Dozen Diamonds vision is to build software technologies combining concepts from behavioral finance and data science to achieve financial well-being of families across the world.</p>
            <p>We believe that the state-of-the-art financial solutions are designed for institutions rather than individuals and hence do not cater to their needs. When applied to families, these solutions treat them as corporate organizations and apply the same financial principles to assess their requirements and capacity. &rdquo;.</p>
            <p>By using principles that are ingrained in mathematics rather than complex approximations in the name of predictive technologies, we aspire to build happy families that can relate to the concepts of finance that run their lives. Our data scientists strive to make sure that the concepts are transparent enough to make sense to a high school graduate, so he never needs to say that “It is all done by AI”.</p>

                  <p>Our data science team has developed the  &ldquo;Stressless Trading Method&rdquo;. The method lays the foundation of trading  strategies we aim to productize, that focus on (a) eliminating the stress  associated with stock trading (b) providing an intuitive easy-to-understand  framework for stock trading that a retail investor can quickly grasp, and (c)  aligning the behavior of the trading activity to match with both the short-term  and long-term goals of the retail trader.</p>

                  <p>Dozen diamonds recognizes that small business loans, often offered to individuals and small business aspirants rely on financial activity of small businesses. For example, a small business is supposed to possess a steady stream of revenue before their capacity to pay back the loan can be evaluated. However, the primary factor that should determine the capacity of an individual to pay back a business loan should also take the financial habits of the individual into consideration. Dozen Diamonds data science team has conceptualized mathematical models for determining the financial habits of individuals by assessing their financial accounts transactional data, and uses these models to assign credit score based on financial habits of individuals. Dozen diamonds is working on gaining access to open banking financial transaction data for applying these algorithms.</p>
